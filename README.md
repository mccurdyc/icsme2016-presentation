# beamer-theme

This is my custom beamer (LaTeX) theme. It is built upon an existing, and awesome beamer theme in [Wronki](http://kaszkowiak.eu/wronki-a-new-beamer-template/_).
Additionally, I received inspiration and guidance in changing the color scheme to the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
from this link [here](http://www.zovirl.com/2011/07/22/solarized_cheat_sheet/).

If you do want to use this clean beamer theme, all that I ask is that you star this repository and you
give me and the other links in this document credit. I hope that you enjoy this theme as much
as I did creating it! Have fun!

## Cloning

`git clone https://github.com/mccurdyc/beamer-theme.git`

## Compiling

You need to compile using `LuaLaTeX` in order to support the custom fonts.
Additionally, the `-shell-escape` is only necessary if you want to use the `minted` package for source code highlighting.

`lualatex -shell-escape beamer.tex`

`lualatex -shell-escape beamer.tex`
